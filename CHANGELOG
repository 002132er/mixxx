==== 2.1 beta 2017-12-22 ====
After two years of hard work, we are pleased to announce Mixxx 2.1 beta. We
have overhauled the effects system, redesigned the skins, added and improved
lots of controller mappings, rewrote the audio file decoders twice, and of
course fixed a bunch of bugs. Download it!

Here is a quick summary of what is new in Mixxx 2.1:
  * Skins scale for high resolution screens
  * Overhauled Deere and LateNight skins
  * New Tango skin
  * Effects are synchronized to the tempo
  * Effects are processed post-fader and post-crossfader and can be previewed
in headphones
  * One metaknob per effect for powerful control of effect chains
  * Nine new effects: Autopan, Biquad Equalizer, Biquad Full Kill Equalizer,
Loudness Contour, Metronome, Parametric Equalizer, Phaser, Stereo Balance,
Tremolo
  * Loaded effects are saved and restored when Mixxx restarts
  * Improved scratching sounds with jog wheels, vinyl control, and dragging
waveforms with the mouse cursor
  * Simplified looping and beatjump controls
  * Configurable rows of 8 samplers with up to 8 rows available for a total of
64 samplers
  * Files loaded to samplers are reloaded when Mixxx restarts
  * Improved volume normalization algorithm (EBU-R 128)

same time
  * Broadcast and record microphones with direct monitoring and latency
compensation
  * Broadcast and record from an external mixer
  * Booth output with independent gain knob for using sound cards with 6
output channels without an external mixer
  * Prevent screensaver from starting while Mixxx is running
  * CUP (Cue And Play) cue button mode
  * Time remaining and time elapsed now take into account the tempo fader
  * Clicking cover art now shows it full size in a separate window
  * and of course, lots and lots of bug fixes.

We will be beta testing 2.1 for 3 months before releasing 2.1 at the end of
March 2018. The beta release will be updated continuously until that time. No
big new features will be added to 2.1 after this point. We will fix small bugs,
continue to polish the skins, and update more controller mappings until the
final 2.1 release. If you have a controller with an old mapping, please
consider contributing an updated mapping for the 2.1 release. We have some
tips for updating controller mappings on the wiki. We will be writing the
English version of the manual during January 2018 to allow two months for
translating it before the release. To get you exciting new features sooner, we
have decided to move to a fixed 6 month release cycle going forward, so look for
Mixxx 2.2 at the end of September 2018.

For users upgrading from older versions of Mixxx, we have an important warning.
The good news is that we fixed a bug where the waveforms and audio playback of
MP3 files were misaligned. The bad news is that we have no way of knowing which
MP3 files were affected or how much the offset was. That means that waveforms,
beatgrids, cues, and loops from older versions of Mixxx may be offset by an
unknown amount for any MP3 file. Only MP3 files were affected by this bug; other
audio file types are unaffected. You can either correct your beatgrids and cue
points manually for each track, or you can clear this information for all MP3s
and start fresh. To do that, type "location:mp3" into the library search bar,
press Control + A to select all tracks, right click, and FIXME!!

In the works for Mixxx 2.2, we have a big redesign of the library GUI.
Along with that will come saving & restoring search queries plus nested crates.
We are also planning on adding support for saving and loading custom effect
chain presets with the ability to import and export them to share online.

Want to contribute to Mixxx? The biggest resource we need is labor. You do not
need to be a programmer to help out. If you are comfortable playing on the
bleeding edge and compiling Mixxx, giving feedback on the design of new
features as they are being made is very valuable. Refer to the Testing page on
the wiki for more information. Reporting bugs and telling us your ideas on the
Launchpad bug tracker is a big help too! Of course, more developers could
always help. Read the Developer Documentation on the wiki for tips on getting
started making Mixxx even more awesome.

We hope you have as much fun with Mixxx as we do!
