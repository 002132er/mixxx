ToDo

# 1024 x 600
  - Skin buttons from center to top row
  - MixerBar goes there, too
  - ...just like the crossfader


* General / Wording / qss
  - remove layout-spacing workarounds when this is fixed
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1578111
  - work around SizeAwareStacks' kicking out Library
    (i.e. when switching from 4 to 2 FX units, LIb and Samplers are disabled)
  - investigate decreasing MinimumSize to 1024px
  - better name for "Extra Deck Buttons"
  - qss: unify button colors (no background-color, deck buttons etc.)
  (- with variables?)
      
* Decks
  - CF assignment buttons with 4 decks
  - replace Deck (text, overview, buttons) when Vinyl passthrough is enabled
    (bit buggy right now, file bug report)
  
* Mixer
  - add Filter knob
  - brighter Gain knob indicator (as well Super knob indicator)
  		
* Mixerbar
  - move on top of Library? optional
  - VUMeter for each section
  - Mute button on each SectionLabel
  - Mic auto-duck button, ducking strength knob
  - make it lower to save space?

* Skin Controls
  - improve positioning of Crossfader in 4-decks mode, as well as for varying FX units
  (- Recording duration widget behind Rec toggler)
  
* FX
  - 2.1 FX Units (MetaKnob, Highlight, Focus)
  - a way to collapse FX units automatically when space is scarse
  - extend group assignment buttons to 4 Mics/4AUX > proper 4th column
  - colorize group assignment buttons like other togglers (OFF grey / ON white with bg-color)
 (- FX chain Save & Load buttons)

* Samplers

* Library
  - distinguish focused/unfocused TreeView/Tracks/other?
    * emphasize border
    * darken background-color when focused
  - SearchBox | Maximize button
        
* Skin Settings menu
  - add option to hide MixerBar when Library is maximized?
  - add option to show MixerBar above Library?
