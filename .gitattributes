# TODO
# Execute the following command in your local project
# directory to enable automatic merge resolution:
#
# $ git config --global merge.ours.driver true
#
# Otherwise the settings in this file are ignored!
#
# Background: Localization files from external sources like
# Transifex must not be merged between release branches and
# should be ignore while merging! Instead those files are
# updated by re-importing them manually from the external
# source. This workflow is supported by configuring the merge
# strategy for the local Git repository appropriately, i.e.
# by excluding those files from merging and always keeping the
# files from the current/target branch (= "ours").

# Exclude Transifex files from merging
/res/translations/*.ts merge=ours
/res/translations/*.qm merge=ours

# Exclude WiX translations from merging
/build/wix/Localization/po/*.po merge=ours
